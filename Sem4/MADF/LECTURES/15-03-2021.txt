# Performance analysis 
	Factors that governs Performance analysis 
	How to compute Performance analysis 
	Crietria for judging the algorithm
	For checking efficiency in terms of implementation
	Space and Time complexity
	Examples of the Space and time complexity
	Define Space complexity
	Prior Estimates (Factor analysis, Performace analysis[to check time complexity, memory used])
	Poserior Testing (Testing of code to check legitimity of code where test cases are given)
	Fixed part space(whoes size of the variable are fixed [int,double,char]) 
	Variable part space(Depends of size of the program ,space and time requirments depends on instance characteristics) 
	Represnation of Space 
	Types of algorithm(sumation algorithm)
	Define Time complexity
	Factors that affect Time complexity
	To estimate the time complexity there is a concept called program step
